### Reflection 
When creating the VM instance with the basic configurations, I noticed that the monthly cost estimate would be $7.11 and $0.01 as the hourly rate. The information caught my eye because we are only supposed to run the VM for a few minutes for the purpose of the assignment and check the costs incurred. After creating the VM instance and letting it run for a few minutes, I went to the billing overview and billing reports section of the platform. These billings sections displayed the total costs as $0.00 from September 1-13. However, both of the billing sections did note that total costs may take a few hours or even more than 24 hours to appear. On the other hand, I am not sure if only running the VM instance for a few minutes contributes to the total cost appearing as $0.00 due to rounding total costs to the nearest tenth of a cent. Furthermore, although I did not successfully create a VM instance on Azure because of permissions, I was able to initiate the process of creating a VM instance. I will attach images below of the steps I was able complete for creating a VM instance on Azure. From my experience of creating or attempting to create a VM instance on both platforms, they were both rather intuitive, but I found the layout of Azure to be more user-friendly and less overwhelming. For stopping and monitoring the VM instance, GCP made the process simple and straightforward. And, based on the example shown in class of creating and stopping a VM instance made on Azure, it looked simple and straightforward as well. Notably, I realized that Azure basically allows users to create a VM from scratch and choose its configurations, while GCP has default configurations already applied. Before starting the process of applying the basic configurations for the assignment on GCP, I was shocked to see the default settings would have a monthly cost of $25.46 and $0.03 as the hourly rate.
